Machine learning on motor imagery data.

Motor imagery is the task of imagining the movement of a limb. This will in turn produce signals from the brain to the arm that are very similar to the signals that the actual movement of the limb would produce. There are multiple ways to sample these signals, but the most common way is to place Ag/AgCl electrodes on the scalp in the 10-20 system [1][1]
